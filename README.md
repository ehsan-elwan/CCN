# Machine-Learning based Energy-Efficient Content Caching in IoT

Content Centric Networking (CCN):

  - An emerging paradigm that grounds networking primitives on content names rather than node locators.
  - CCN affords efficient caching capabilities and ensures high content availability
  - Network traffic reduction, and low retrieval latency which reduces congestion and improve end-to-end delay.
  
### Tech

> ◘ [Python] - Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language
> ◘ [CCN] - Centric networking emphasizes content by making it directly addressable and routable
> ◘ [Reinforcement learning] - Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
> ◘ [Q-learning] - Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a policy telling an agent what action to take under what circumstances


### Todos

 - implement the model
 - couple this part of the code with the Ad-hoc script
 - choose a cache replacement policy
 - choose learning strategy "Scheduled, individual or hybrid"

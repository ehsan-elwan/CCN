# CCN
Machine-Learning based Energy-Efficient Content Caching in IoT


Content Centric Networking (CCN):

● An emerging paradigm that grounds networking primitives on content names rather than node locators.
● CCN affords efficient caching capabilities and ensures high content availability, network traffic reduction, and low retrieval latency which reduces congestion and improve end-to-end delay.
